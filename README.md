# Ultimora
Use of a Noritake Itron GU140X32F-7703A VFD to display Televideo's (italian Teletext) Ultim'Ora (latest news).
The display is used in text mode where it can show four lines of 20 characters, the program runs on a Raspberry Pi and uses a second serial port as the mein one is already occupied with my other display.
